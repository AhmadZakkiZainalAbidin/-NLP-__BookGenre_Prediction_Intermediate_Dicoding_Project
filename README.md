# Book Genre Prediction‚≠ê
# About Dataset‚≠ê
The main aim here is to predict the genre of the book based on the synopsis of the book. This is the subset of the dataset that I previously created which also contained additional features such as rating, author followers etc. but this contains more number of books. And more will be added in the future. Visit this [**LINK**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/athu1105/book-genre-prediction) for further information
